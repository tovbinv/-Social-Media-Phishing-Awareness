# Social Media Phishing Awareness Project

## Introduction

This project is designed to raise awareness about phishing attacks on social media platforms. It uses a unique and interactive approach to educate users about the dangers of phishing attacks in a safe and controlled environment.

## Project Components

The project involves three main components:

1. **Phishing Websites**: Two websites that mimic popular social media platforms. These websites are designed to look and feel like the real platforms.

2. **Phishing Email**: An urgent email that appears to be a security alert from the social media platform. The email contains a link that directs the user to one of our phishing websites.

3. **Educational Guide**:When a user enters their credentials on the phishing website, they are redirected to an educational guide. This guide explains that they have just participated in a simulated phishing attack and provides information on how to identify and avoid such attacks in the future.

## Usage

To use this project, simply send the phishing email to the user. When they click on the link and enter their credentials, they will be redirected to the educational guide.
